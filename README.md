Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) is an amateur radio-based system for real time tactical digital
communications of information of immediate value in the local area.[1] In addition, all such data are ingested
into the APRS Internet System (APRS-IS) and distributed globally for ubiquitous and immediate access. Along with
messages, alerts, announcements, and bulletins, the most visible aspect of APRS is its map display. Anyone may
place any object or information on his or her map, and it is distributed to all maps of all users in the local
RF network or monitoring the area via the Internet. Any station, radio, or object that has an attached GPS is
automatically tracked. Other prominent map features are weather stations, alerts and objects and other map-related
amateur radio volunteer activities including Search and Rescue and signal direction finding.

APRS has been developed since the late 1980s by Bob Bruninga, callsign WB4APR, currently a senior research engineer
at the United States Naval Academy. He still maintains the main APRS website. The acronym "APRS" was derived from
his callsign.
